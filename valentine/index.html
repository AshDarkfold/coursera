            Dear Aanya, 

Alfred Lord Tennyson once said, "If I had a flower for every time I thought of you, I could walk through my garden forever." 
I do not know where to start. It has just been such an amazing 3 years together for us. Everyday when I wake up, the first thought that comes to my mind is your smile. I eagerly wait for the time when we finally meet during the day. Whenever I am with you, I feel so lucky to be holding your hand and walking by your side. You make me feel so special about myself. You're the most beautiful person ever for me. I can't put into words how I feel when we kiss. Every moment spent with you is invaluable. 
I would take this opportunity to just thank you for always being there by my side. You have been an amazing girlfriend. We are very lucky to have come together to the same college. I couldn't have asked for more from life itself. On this Valentines Day, I just wanna say thank you for everything you have done for me. I really hope, and I know that we will always be together. And you can stay assured that I will always give everything I physically can to our relationship. The moments we spend now are invaluable. As Charlie said in Perks of Being a Wallflower,
"I know there are people who say all these things don’t happen. And there are people who forget what it’s like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen. I know these will all be stories some day, and our pictures will become old photographs. We all become somebody’s mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here, and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you’re not a sad story. You are alive. And you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you’re listening to that song, and that drive with the people who you love most in this world. And in this moment, I swear, we are infinite." 
And you know it yourself how right he is about this. We are infinite in this moment. And nothing can ever change that. This Valentines Day, I just want you to know that hey, I'm here. And I'm here to stay. All the bad times are over. Its our time to live now. Its our time to be happy. Its our time to smile now. Its our time to enjoy and do things we always wanted to do. And no one can ever take these moments away from us. I've said it so many times Aanya and I'll again quote Bella from Twilight and say, I am unconditionally and irrevocably in love with you. And not even an unstoppable force can change that. I don't wanna make this too long a read so yeah I'll just end by saying this: Thank You for existing
Happy Valentines Day Baby. 
I love you
Your loving Boyfriend,
Hishaam
